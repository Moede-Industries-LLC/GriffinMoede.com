The idea here is to have each “view” be a different perspective of the room, and thus its own “page” in the website. So if you click on the guitar, it will take you to a page where the background of the page is you looking at the wall with the guitar on it. I’ll probably put the guitar off to the side in that sort of case, to give you room to embed the soundcloud module. 

I will provide these views (as paintings). Also, if you need me to paint any ‘back’ buttons or anything custom, let me know and I will provide that. The scale of the painting is chunky, so if someone stretches the screen wider, you would crop off the top and bottom. I’m also going to widen the painting soon. We should discuss how we might approach screen sizing and stuff.

The top answer in this link is how I picture we create clickable areas in the image. As far as sizing goes, we may have to get creative, like using ratios of screen width/height to define the clickable areas instead of static pixel values. Does that make sense? And I think having rectangles to define the clickable objects is perfectly fine, we don’t need to trace the object or anything like that. 

- Gallery Page (I’ll create a bitmap of the border image (of a frame) I’d like you to use, and use that as a border/frame around the images of my paintings. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image )
